## Scripts Overview

### Script 1 — System Identity Report
**File:** `script1_system_identity.sh`  
**Description:** Displays a system welcome screen showing the Linux distribution name, kernel version, current logged-in user, home directory, system uptime, current date/time, and the open-source license covering the OS.  
**Concepts Used:** Variables, `echo`, command substitution (`$()`), output formatting.

---

### Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector
**File:** `script2_package_inspector.sh`  
**Description:** Checks whether the chosen software package is installed on the system, retrieves its version and metadata, and uses a `case` statement to print a short philosophical description of its purpose.  
**Concepts Used:** `if-then-else`, `case` statement, `rpm -qi` / `dpkg -l`, pipe with `grep`.

---

### Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor
**File:** `script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh`  
**Description:** Loops through a list of important system directories (`/etc`, `/var/log`, `/home`, `/usr/bin`, `/tmp`) and reports disk usage and owner/permission details for each. Also checks if the chosen software's config directory exists.  
**Concepts Used:** `for` loop, `df`, `ls -ld`, `awk`, `cut`.

---

### Script 4 — Log File Analyzer
**File:** `script4_log_analyzer.sh`  
**Description:** Reads a log file line by line, counts occurrences of a specified keyword (default: `error`), and prints a summary. Accepts the log file path and keyword as command-line arguments.  
**Concepts Used:** `while read` loop, `if-then`, counter variables, command-line arguments (`$1`, `$2`).

---

### Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator
**File:** `script5_manifesto_generator.sh`  
**Description:** Interactively asks the user three questions and generates a personalised open-source philosophy statement, saving the output to a `.txt` file named after the current user.  
**Concepts Used:** `read` for user input, string concatenation, file writing with `>` and `>>`, `date` command.
